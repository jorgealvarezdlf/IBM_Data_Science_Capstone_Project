    "**London** is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. Its estimated mid-2018 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London) was roughly 9 million, which made it the third-most populous city in Europe. London accounts for 13.4% of the U.K. population. Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census.\n",

    "London has been one of the world's top tourism cities for many years, and a key gateway for domestic and international visitors. The total number of visitors in London, including domestic tourists, is estimated at 12 million per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, tourism is the second most important sector for the economy of the city after financial services, contributing 12% to its GDP. Tourism, therefore, plays a vital role for London. The sector employs 700,000 people and contributes Â£36 billion a year to the economy. Tourism also helps to strengthen London's reputation as an open and welcoming global city."

    "London is a world tourist destination with many visitors each year. The information available concerning tourism in London can be overwhelming and considering trips made to London for holiday purposes lasted 4.8 nights on average in 2019, according to Statista, a good planning is necessary to make the most of the holidays, avoiding downtimes. London has full potential to become the best city to visit in Europe but it still has challenges for visitors such as not using public transport wisely, waiting in long queues as a result of a poor planning and failing to research available attractions."
